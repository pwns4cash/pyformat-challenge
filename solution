{self.ask_secret.__globals__[SECRET]}

#i have no idea how to get this to work properly... this is the solution though. I was able to pull the value of SECRET, but since the value of secrets.token_hex() 
#always changes I didn't know how to validate it.  I updated the value of SECRET a string and was able to return that string.  Solved.
